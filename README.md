A quiz with top movies from IMDB

Using an Array that can contain unlimited movies I shuffle out a random image with four alternatives. The image is only going to show one time per game.
The name of the movie should not show the name more then one time per round and the right answer's place should be random and not fall on the same place. 
After the user has answered the result shows if it was right or wrong. 
And lastly the results should show with a option to play again. 

PS, the names inside of my files is based on that the quiz was originally for showing our classmates but I changed the images to movies for Github.
